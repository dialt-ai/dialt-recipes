# Dialt + Twilio inbound bridge

This runnable integration connects an inbound Twilio phone call to one Dialt session. Twilio
owns the phone number and call; this bridge owns deployment, audio transport and application
tools; Dialt owns the realtime voice conversation.

This is the maintained Twilio reference for Dialt. The Dialt repository and dialt.com docs point
here and keep no copy of their own.

It uses Twilio bidirectional Media Streams. It does not require Twilio ConversationRelay.

## Run it

From this directory:

```sh
cp env.example .env
uv sync --frozen
uv run uvicorn bridge:app --env-file .env --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

The environment holds only secrets and deployment endpoints. The agent's role is application
logic, so it lives in the versioned `instructions.md` next to `bridge.py`: who the agent answers
for, what it does and how it handles unclear requests. Edit it for your application, or set
`DIALT_INSTRUCTIONS_FILE` to use a different file; a relative path resolves against the bridge's
directory. Dialt requires instructions on every session and states no role of its own, so the
bridge refuses to start if the file is missing or empty.

Put the app behind public HTTPS and set `PUBLIC_BASE_URL` to that exact external origin, for
example `https://voice.example.com`. Configure the Twilio phone number's incoming Voice webhook
as `POST https://voice.example.com/voice`.

The webhook returns `<Connect><Stream>`. The bridge:

- verifies Twilio signatures for the HTTP and WebSocket requests;
- converts Twilio's 8 kHz G.711 mu-law audio to Dialt's 16 kHz wire format;
- converts Dialt output back to Twilio audio; and
- maps Twilio `mark` and `clear` playback state to Dialt interruption events.

## Add application tools

Edit `tool_manifest()` and `execute_tool()` in `bridge.py`. Keep service credentials and effects
inside the bridge. Only tool schemas, bounded arguments and bounded results should cross the
Dialt session.

## Optional human handoff

Set both variables below to expose the permission-gated `request_human_handoff` tool:

```sh
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=ACxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
TWILIO_HUMAN_HANDOFF_URL=https://voice.example.com/handoff
```

After the caller approves a handoff, the bridge redirects the active Twilio call to the configured
HTTPS URL. That customer-owned endpoint returns the TwiML for the real destination, such as a
`<Dial>`, queue, conference, Flex flow or TaskRouter workflow. The destination is configuration
and is never supplied by the model.

This is a cold-transfer reference, not a generic contact-center implementation. The tool provides a
reason and concise summary to `execute_tool()`, which never puts either in a URL. Persist them by
`CallSid` before redirecting if the receiving agent needs context. Keep the handoff endpoint
authenticated according to Twilio's webhook-security guidance.

## Test it

```sh
uv run pytest -q
```

The tests are offline and require no Dialt or Twilio credentials.

This is an inbound reference integration, not a dialer.

## Built on dialt_recipes.twilio

The transport (paced outbound audio, playback accounting, barge-in clears, tool dispatch, drain
and hang-up) lives in the `dialt_recipes.twilio` module of this repository's package, so this
file is only what is yours: configuration, the routes Twilio calls, the agent's mode, and what
each tool does. Inside the repository the example runs against the checkout; a standalone copy
installs `dialt-recipes` from git through its `pyproject.toml`.

## Opener and outbound audio

`DIALT_GREETING` is spoken on pickup, pre-rendered so the caller hears it at once. Since
dialt-sdk 0.20 it is the conversation's first assistant turn: the agent knows it said it, the
caller can interrupt it, and only the heard prefix stays in context. It may therefore ask the
first question.

Outbound audio is sent at the line's own rate: one 20 ms frame per 20 ms, at most 200 ms ahead,
with a playback mark every 100 ms. Sending each reply as a burst with a mark per frame was
measured (Twilio's dual-channel recording against the session's own track, 2026-09-04) at one
fifth of frames never reaching the caller; pacing halved that and removed every hole longer
than 180 ms.
