# Dialt recipes

Runnable patterns built entirely from the public
[`dialt-sdk`](https://pypi.org/project/dialt-sdk/) and
[`@dialt/sdk`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@dialt/sdk) surfaces.

The boundary is deliberate: Dialt owns conversation; recipes own application policy and
orchestration. There is no parallel simulator client and no eval-only conversation engine. A
simulated user is another Dialt session. Text and voice select different I/O on the same
session primitive.

## Integrations

[`examples/integrations/twilio`](examples/integrations/twilio) is the maintained inbound Twilio
Media Streams bridge. It is a standalone uv project with configuration instructions and offline
tests, including the optional customer-controlled human handoff.

```sh
cd examples/integrations/twilio
cp env.example .env
uv sync --frozen
uv run pytest -q
```

## Install

```sh
uv sync
cp .env.example .env
```

## Qualification and specialist handoff

[`examples/qualification_handoff`](examples/qualification_handoff) collects configurable qualification fields, handles corrections, obtains explicit consent, and calls a customer-owned specialist handoff. It includes text and voice eval cases plus Python callback seams, and reuses the maintained Twilio bridge for live calls.

## Agent-to-agent hand-off on one call

[`examples/agent_to_agent_handoff`](examples/agent_to_agent_handoff) puts two agent personas on
one call: an obviously synthetic intake voice takes the patient's details, calls a hand-off
tool, and the host declares the specialist's tools, switches the session voice and returns the
handover note as the tool result. The specialist continues the same session with intake's
context intact. A clinic appointment line is the worked example. Eval cases rendered from the
workflow, a local host that confirms the switch from the session's `voice` event, and a Twilio
wiring sketch.

## Guided customer-research assistant

[`examples/guided_customer_research`](examples/guided_customer_research) is a non-trivial guided
interview. A `ConversationPlan` declares the evidence to collect; an optional client tool records
answers. The model still handles wording, clarification, corrections, order and transitions
naturally.

Run the terminal version in text mode:

```sh
uv run dialt-guided examples/guided_customer_research/plan.json
```

The browser example supports text and voice with the same plan. Recording is off by default; enable it to show structured evidence live.
Serve the repository directory, open the example, and paste a short-lived scoped session key (not
a persistent `ck_` key).

## Evals: run cases locally, then push them

A case is one JSON file, the same document the hosted evals API accepts: `name`, `starter` (or
`target.greeting`, when the agent opens the call and the simulated user answers it), `target`
(`instructions`, `tools`, `end_call`), `simulator` (`instructions`), `fixtures`, `checks` and
`limits`. [`examples/simulations/appointment_booking.json`](examples/simulations/appointment_booking.json)
is a complete one. Field reference: the [evals guide](https://dialt.com/docs/api/evals/).

The agent ends a call by calling the managed `end_call` tool, which `target.end_call` (default
true) gives it; set it to false for an agent that must never hang up, or to
`{"when": "the caller confirms the booking is complete"}` to state the condition in the
agent's own terms. The simulated user always has it. Either call is recorded as a tool call named `end_call`, so `completed` means the agent
ended the call and `simulator_ended` means the simulated user did.

Run a case, or every case in a directory, locally. Two Dialt sessions talk to each other: the
target agent and a simulated caller. Text forwards committed utterances; voice gives each session
a virtual microphone that streams for the whole call (the other side's audio at real time, line
noise in between, exactly as a phone line would) and never touches a speaker or microphone.

```sh
uv run dialt-sim examples/simulations/ --modality text
uv run dialt-sim examples/simulations/appointment_booking.json --modality voice
```

The deterministic checks (`contains`, `not_contains`, `regex`, `tool_called`,
`fixture_complete`, `max_turns`) run here with the same rules as hosted runs; `judge` checks
need the judge model and are reported as skipped locally. An undeclared tool fails closed, as it
does hosted, so a local pass means the case declares every tool the agent uses.

Push the same files and run them hosted. Cases are matched by name, so a re-push updates the
hosted case instead of duplicating it; the run appears on the
[Evals dashboard](https://dialt.com/evals).

```sh
uv run dialt-evals push examples/simulations/ --modality text --wait
```

With `--wait` the command exits non-zero unless the run passes, so it can gate a CI job in your
agent's repository: put `DIALT_API_KEY` in a secret and run it on every change to the agent or
its cases. Without `--wait` it returns as soon as the run is queued.

To answer tool calls with your own Python instead of fixed fixtures, build the case in code; see
[`examples/simulations/with_callbacks.py`](examples/simulations/with_callbacks.py). Hosted runs
accept fixed and `field_store` fixtures only.

## Tests

```sh
uv run pytest
```

The default suite is offline and secret-free. The manual GitHub workflow runs a bounded live text
or blackholed-voice smoke when `DIALT_API_KEY` is configured.
